======================

 widget that allows you to choose between the different resources availables in a CKAN instance

## Build

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](http://node.js) and [Bower](http://bower.io)
in your system. For example, you can install it on Ubunutu and Debian running the
following commands:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g bower
```

Install other npm dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

For build the widget you need download grunt:

```bash
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And now, you can use grunt:

```bash
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the **build** folder.
